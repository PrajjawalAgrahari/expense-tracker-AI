Here are several ways you can extend and improve your expense tracker chatbot's functionality:

## Core Expense Management Features

**Enhanced Expense Operations**
- **Expense Queries**: Enable users to ask "How much did I spend on groceries this month?" or "Show me my restaurant expenses from last week"
- **Expense Modification**: Allow editing existing expenses through commands like "Change yesterday's lunch expense to $30"
- **Expense Deletion**: Support removal with "Delete my coffee purchase from this morning"
- **Bulk Operations**: Handle multiple expenses in one conversation: "I spent $50 on groceries, $25 on gas, and $15 on coffee today"

**Smart Categorization**
- **Auto-categorization**: Train your Rasa model to automatically categorize expenses based on keywords and context
- **Category Suggestions**: When ambiguous, ask "I see you spent money at Starbucks. Should I categorize this as 'Coffee' or 'Dining'?"
- **Custom Categories**: Allow users to create and manage custom expense categories through chat

## Advanced Analytics and Insights

**Intelligent Reporting**
- **Spending Summaries**: Generate reports like "Give me my monthly spending breakdown" or "Compare this month to last month"
- **Budget Tracking**: Integrate with budget limits and provide alerts: "You've spent 80% of your dining budget this month"

## User Experience Enhancements
